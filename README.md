# Data Science Competitions group at ChiHackNight
Main repo for Chicago Learn Data Science from Competitions

### About the group
We believe in learning data science by doing competitions, together.

Each week, we pick a data science competition from sources such as; Kaggle.com, kdnuggets.com or DataDriven.com to discuss and exercise. If we have someone who has done the competition already, the person may showcase his or her kernel and result to the group as a guideline. At the end of the night, each participant or team may present their kernel, finding, and result to the group.

### Who we're looking for
Whether you want to get better at data wrangling, feature engineering, model selection or just want to have fun solving non-trivial data science problems and meet other data enthusiasts, this is the right group to join!

Another benefit is the opportunity to practice sharing your data story to the group. This is an important soft skill that every data scientist needs to know.
